<h1>Experiment 1:</h1><br>
<h3>Aim : Hello World and Calculator program</h3>
<h3>Software used : VS Code</h3>
<br>
<h2>Theory :</h2>
<h4>Hello World is the basic program in any language. In this experiment we will learn basic syntax of C++ and how to perform any operations using C++.</h4>
<h4>We used "iostream" library which consist of many functions from which for hello world we used "cout" which is used to print on terminal. "#include" tells to include all the fuctions from the "iostream" library and "using namespace std" tells that the namespace is std.</h4>
<h3>Namesapce: </h3>
<h4>Namespace is a container under which we can write our code to prevent conflicts and in this code the namespace is "std".</h4><br>
<h3>For Calculator program: </h3>
<h4>For Calculator program I used basic maths addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We took input from user using "cin".</h4><br>
<h3>Conclusion : I learnt how to write code in C++ and do basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division using C++.</h3>
